======== Applied Refactorings ========
Iteration 1: "Make Method Final" applied at class Make to method compile(beaver.comp.io.SrcReader,beaver.comp.run.Options,beaver.comp.util.Log)
Iteration 2: "Make Method Static" applied at class GrammarScanner to method zzScanError(int)
Iteration 3: "Decrease Method Visibility" applied at class Terminal\Associativity to method Associativity(java.lang.String) from private to package
Iteration 4: "Make Class Abstract" applied to class Action\Type\Conflict
Iteration 5: "Decrease Method Visibility" applied at class Configuration\Set to method reverseReversePropagation() from package to protected
Iteration 6: "Remove Method" applied at class GrammarScanner to method yystate()
